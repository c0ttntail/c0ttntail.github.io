            Time: Seconds halved is the value(takes 10 seconds or more=5, takes 2 seconds or less=1)<br><br>
            Velocity: Cubes Per Second divided by 8(40+ is 5, 8- is 1, speed disk is about 4)<br><br>
            Range: Quarters of the ring(1 is less than a quarter of the ring, 5 is more than the length of the ring)<br><br>
            Situationality: Prerequisites(1-2 for self setup, 3 for debris, 4-5 for FGFA or RTS)<br><br>
            Height: Per cube height(1 is less than a cube height, 2 is less than 2 cubes height, etc, 5 is 4 cubes and up)<br><br>
            Control: How consistently controllable it is(1-2 for difficult to control(like explode), 3 for easy to control(like straightline attacks), 4 for puppet or bump flight with very consistent control, 5 for extreme control like stable flight or multistructure flight)<br><br>
            Damage: damage/2 rounded up( disk and ball are 1, pillar and cube are 2, wall and grounded wall are 3, boulder is 4, multistructure is 5)<br><br>
            Creativity: How many mechanics are used(Iron boots, Stucture launch, locking, flight, hit combos, etc.)</p>
